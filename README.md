# dbd
Simple DB for fun and for database internal discovery, especially the distributed one.

Thus :

- the forecated features are minimalistic : simple key / value database
- consistency is not the main focus. Availibility and Partition Tolerance are.
- consensus and replication mechanism are at the core. Should be simple to use AND reliable
- should be fast and optimized enough
